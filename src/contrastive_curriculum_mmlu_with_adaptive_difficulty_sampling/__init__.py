"""Contrastive Curriculum MMLU with Adaptive Difficulty Sampling.

This package implements a novel approach to few-shot learning on MMLU that combines:
1. Contrastive representation learning with subject-domain clustering
2. Adaptive curriculum strategies based on model uncertainty gradients
3. Difficulty-aware sampling mechanism for efficient task exposure
